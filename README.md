## **Why I Built This** 🤔

**PokéVault** started as my way of leveling up my backend and cloud deployment skills. It’s my first Spring Boot project, and I wanted to challenge myself by integrating the following:

- **Cloud Deployment**: Setting up and managing a live app on AWS.  
- **Secure Development**: Implementing encrypted user authentication.  
- **API Integration**: Fetching and persisting large datasets and extracting into Objects.
